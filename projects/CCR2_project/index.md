description: Project describing the role of CCR2+ neutrophils in atherosclerotic plaque destabilization. 
Code for analysis of scRNA data

## Overview

The code combines published data and own scRNA data, integrates them and substract the identified neutrophils. 
Analysis of the expression of Ccr2 counts on neutrophils allow us to compare transcriptomically the phenotype of both pos and neg subsets.
